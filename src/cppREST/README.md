# cppREST
A library written in C++, intended to be used for implementing HTTP API servers. Since the project heavily relies on QT, the library also uses it (to work with sockets). cppREST allows to create servers that use only HTTPS protocol (HTTP is not suported). For each new request a new thread is created.
