=== TODO ===

libs:
- VariantList:
    - determine file format from file header instead of file name => make more tools pipeable
    - use QSharedPointers to link VariantAnnotationHeaders with VariantAnnotationDescriptions (CS)
    - check vcf and tsv files if valid - columns and their descriptions (CS)
- NGSHelper: consider soft-clipping of secondary alignments (CS)
- integration of htslib: use pileup, use VCF support

GSvar:
** Add pLI score (megSAP) and filter for pLI (GSvar) to CNVs
** Add literature search button (Google/Pubmed, gene/variant)
  - "LAMP2" ("586A>T" | "586Aâ€”>T" | "586A-->T" | "586A/T" | "Thr1965er" | "T1965" | rs138991195)
  - "LAMP2" ("mutation" / "cardiomyopathy" / "arrhythmia")
* Somatic: also load CNV file of germline
* GenLab XML report: male => change 'hom' variants outside PAR region on chrX/chrY to 'hemi' (when GenLab import is updated)
- text-based filter for OMIM/ClinVar/HGMD column (ignore case)
- Add genotype equal for affected
- Make default filters configurable in INI file

Tools:
** add new tool BedHighCoverage (similar to samtools depth)
- SampleCorrelation: Add option to use only rare snps e.g. 0.1-10.0% AF in VCF/GSvar mode
- SomaticQC: do not use precalculated triplet counts, count every time (CS)
- SomaticQC: replace 'QC:?' by real qcML identifier (CS)
- BamClipOverlap: require sorted bam and paired-end sequencing (CS)
- BamClipOverlap: use higher base quality in overlap (CS)

External:
** implement MultiQC support for ReadQC/MappingQC/VariantQC/SomaticQC > Jakob
** implement ngs-bits recipe in BioConda > deploy > link to Docker container > commit updated build instructions.

CnvHunter:
** Add z-score of #CNVs as QC parameter (megSAP!?)
** Add support for chrY
* test sqrt-normalization
- replace fun_* by methods from BasicStatistics, i.e. rewrite the methods in BasicStatistics as template functions that accept both float and double
- test GC-normalization (check GS151166_01 C5orf42, DX170123_01 SEC23B del)
    - test effect of including different flanking regions
    - alternatively, test intra-sample normalization using the most similar exons on different chromosomes
- test with duplicate reads; with anomalous reads; with multi-mapped reads; chunked data
- allow input of one multi-sample COV file (reduce test data size and loading time)

RohHunter:
- optimize quality cutoffs based on variants that are het on chrX for males (AF, DP, MQM, blacklist, InDels, no AF annotation, homopolymer region,...)
- test splitting regions when dist is too high, e.g. > 100Kb => Q-score cutoff removes random parts?!
- test input of high-cov ROI to augment the input data with WT SNPs with AF>1-5%
- test if sub-population AF improves result
- benchmarks: chrX of males, add errors up to 2 percent, overlap WGS/WES
