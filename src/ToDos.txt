=== TODO ===

libs:
- test cppNGSD (include in libs)

GSvar:
- implement variant details dock widget (like sophia-genetics), show inheritance/comments from geneinfo_germline
* Add HPO => Genes => Target region Dialog
* Add gene managenement dialog: Inititialize from OMIM if parsing of inheritance is available

Tools:
- MappingQC:
  - add %soft/hard-clipped quality parameter (see ssPWBRCA_v2)
  * support RNA: insert size, spike-in controls, mapping ribosomes/globulines, etc.
- SeqPurge:
  * avoid overtrimming of 10-1 bases at read ends - allow 2-3 errors
  - add optional error correction and show error profile for both runs
  - low-quality trimming before adapter trimming? use single-base instead of sliding window?
? FastqDemultiplex: check for "carry-over" contamination from last run
? ReadQC: create plots without python

CnvHunter:
 * output ref samples header: print ref correlation and ref sample list (without single sample correlation)
 * instead of fixed 'n', use n>=10 and n<=30 with lowest number of CNVs or lowest z-score stdev?
 * calculate Z-score cutoff for each sample instead of fixed Z-score
 - do not use bad regions for sample correlation calculation - remove bad regions after writing regions file...
 - do not exclude extreme outliers from reference sample calculation - we use median/mad
 - why "data[s].ref.append(exon_median);" - always use median/mad!?
 - annotate number of CNVs for each region in result file
 - merge larger regions to one region - use CBS!
 - integrate CNV databases:
