=== TODO ===

libs:
- cppNGS:
   - VariantList:
      - use QSharedPointers to link VariantAnnotationHeaders with VariantAnnotationDescriptions
      - check vcf and tsv files if valid (columns and their descriptions)
   - Statistics:
      - somatic(): normalize mutation signature (plot2) for panels using the reference genome, e.g. count of CCG in target region divided by CCG in the genome
      - somatic(): normalize variant distance (plot3) for panels, e.g. calculate distances by target regions
      - somatic(): add support for freebayes, currently only vcfs from strelka can be used
      - somatic(): add plot comparing depth tumor/normal and allele frequencies of dbSNP variants
      - somatic(): add cnv count - QCValue("somatic CNVs count", "", "Needs to be implemented.", "QC:2000044")
      - somatic(): consider to use only filtered variants for statistics?
      - somatic(): check if target file works, make it faster
      - somatic(): remove nonSpecialChromosomes from all statistics parameters
- cppNGS-Tests:
   - VariantFilter: Overview gene lists (missing genotype): treat all variants as homozygous?
   - Statistics: add Tests for somatic statistics
- cppNGSD: add test project

GSvar:
* Report: add statistics about gaps in CCDS+0bp regions and print overall sequenced size without gaps (consider only longest/preferred transcript)
- Implement update tool that automatically checks for new versions, or find solution with reference to sub-folders (ask Martin)
- Add buttons to search in goolge/pubmed for variant

Tools:
* VariantQC: add mean deviation from expected AFs (0.0, 0.5, 1.0) for all high-coverage dbSNP SNPs to detect contamintations ('n/a' for SNP count<30 samples) => show in NGSD ps/run QC (cutoff 0.07/0.08)
* Read-/MappingQC: Add statistics about raw sequenced size and usable sequenced size
- VariantFilterRegions, etc: Set input file format by command line argument => allow reading variant lists from stdin
- MappingQC:
  - add %soft/hard-clipped quality parameter (see ssPWBRCA_v2)
  * support RNA: insert size, spike-in controls, mapping ribosomes/globulines, etc.
- SeqPurge:
  - try using QBitArray instead of QByteArray to speed up sequence match counting.
  - low-quality trimming before adapter trimming? use single-base instead of sliding window?
- SomaticQC: write test
- VcfCheck: Format check for vcf files

CnvHunter:
 * add GC-normalization (then, check GS151166_01 gene C5orf42)
 * merge large CNVs to one region - use CBS or slope-based algorithm based on cummulative relative coverage.
 * normalize Z-scores to mean 0 and stdev 1 to correct for sample quality
 * instead of fixed 'n', use n>=10 and n<=30 with highest correlation or lowest z-score stdev?
 ? output: median instead of mean for "CNV events/sample/100 regions" and "regions/CNV event"
