=== TODO ===

NGSD changes:
- test BedGeneOverlap (db-file)
- test CnvHunter (db-file)
- test GenesToBed (db-file)
- test BedAnnotateGenes (db-file)

GSvar:
- somatic sample: Filter (MAF + custom)

GSmix:
- Support copy-and-paste of text in fields

Tools:
- SeqPurge: add error correction
- FastqDemultiplex: check for "carry-over" contamination from last run
- ReadQC: create plots without python?
- SampleOverview: add option for BAM files (check depth where variant is not found)

CnvHunter
 - consider normalizing for read length somehow (or use read counts? But that does not help much either)
 - set min STDEV to 15% of mean (was 10%, make it a parameter)
 - do not use bad regions for sample correlation calculation - remove bad regions after writing regions file...
 - do not exclude extreme outliers from reference sample calculation - we use median/mad
 - why "data[s].ref.append(exon_median);" - always use median/mad!?
 - annotate number of CNVs for each region in result file
 - determine z-score cutoff for each sample individually?
 - merge larger regions to one region - otherwise they may be filter out
 - integrate CNV databases:
   - http://dgv.tcag.ca/gb2/gbrowse/dgv2_hg19/
   - https://decipher.sanger.ac.uk/disorders#syndromes/overview
 - instead of fixed 'n', majority vote for CNVs for n>=10 and n<=30?
