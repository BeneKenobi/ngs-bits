=== TODO ===

* test cppNGSD (include in libs)


GSvar:
* implement variant details dock widget (like sophia-genetics)
* integrate HPO (phenotype(s) => temporary target region)
* implement filter column 'filter' icon that excludes all other variants
- somatic sample: Filter (MAF + custom)

GSmix:
- Support copy-and-paste of text in fields

Tools:
- MappingQC: add %soft/hard-clipped quality parameter (see ssPWBRCA_v2)
- SeqPurge: add error correction?
- FastqDemultiplex: check for "carry-over" contamination from last run
- ReadQC: create plots without python?
- SampleOverview: add option for BAM files (check depth where variant is not found)

CnvHunter:
 * instead of fixed 'n', use n>=10 and n<=30 with lowest number of CNVs?
 * calculate Z-score for each sample instead of fixed Z-score
 - consider normalizing for read length somehow (or use read counts? But that does not help much either)
 - set min STDEV to 15% of mean (was 10%, make it a parameter)
 - do not use bad regions for sample correlation calculation - remove bad regions after writing regions file...
 - do not exclude extreme outliers from reference sample calculation - we use median/mad
 - why "data[s].ref.append(exon_median);" - always use median/mad!?
 - annotate number of CNVs for each region in result file
 - determine z-score cutoff for each sample individually?
 - merge larger regions to one region - otherwise they may be filter out
 - integrate CNV databases:
