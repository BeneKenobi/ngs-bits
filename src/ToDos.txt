=== TODO ===

libs:
- cppNGS:
   - VariantList:
      - use QSharedPointers to link VariantAnnotationHeaders with VariantAnnotationDescriptions
      - check vcf and tsv files if valid (columns and their descriptions)
   - Statistics:
      - somatic(): add plot comparing depth tumor/normal and allele frequencies of dbSNP variants
      - somatic(): add cnv count - QCValue("somatic CNVs count", "", "Needs to be implemented.", "QC:2000044")
   - NGSHelper:
      - consider soft-clipping of secondary alignments
- cppNGS-Tests:
   - VariantFilter: Overview gene lists (missing genotype): treat all variants as homozygous?
   - Statistics: add Tests for somatic statistics

GSvar:
* remove NGSD dependency of IGV jumping
* check ExAC annotation for chr2:215657183 A>- and chr5:56177849 CAA>- in NA12878_06 (should be 43%)
* Implement update tool that automatically checks for new versions, or find solution with reference to sub-folders (ask Martin)
- Allow handling of several affected (i.e. integrate SampleOverview functionality)
- Add buttons to search in goolge/pubmed for variant

Tools:
* MappingQC: Add "clipped base percentage" parameter for soft-clipped und hard-clipped bases.
* VariantFilterRegions, etc: Set input file format by command line argument => allow reading variant lists from stdin
* MappingQC: support RNA: insert size, spike-in controls, mapping ribosomes/globulines, etc.
- SeqPurge:
  ? try using QBitArray instead of QByteArray to speed up sequence match counting.
  ? try pre-calculating all probabilities (bounded by factorial overflow) and test performance on large dataset.
  ? low-quality trimming before adapter trimming? use single-base instead of sliding window?
- SomaticQC: write test

CnvHunter:
 * add on-refererence input BAM files paramter (for cancer, FFPE, ...)
 * update test data (include MAPQ=0, types: HBOC, TruRisk, Exome, Low-coverage genome data, Cancer data)
 * add optional GC-normalization (then, check GS151166_01 gene C5orf42) - test effect of including different flanking regions
 * test caclulate real ncov distribution also when enough data points are available. How many are that? Test/Simulate! (see line ~700: 'values.count()==n')
 * test mappability-normalization and exon-size normalization
 * test percentile normalization
 * test normalizing Z-scores to mean 0 and stdev 1 to correct for sample quality
 * test on HaloPlex HS data, multi-mapped data, chunked data
 * test using n>=10 and n<=30 with highest correlation or lowest z-score stdev instead of fixed 'n'
