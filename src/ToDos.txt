=== TODO ===

libs:
- cppNGS:
   - VariantList:
      - use QSharedPointers to link VariantAnnotationHeaders with VariantAnnotationDescriptions
      - check vcf and tsv files if valid (columns and their descriptions)
   - Statistics:
      - somatic(): normalize variant distance (plot3) for panels, e.g. calculate distances by target regions
      - somatic(): add plot comparing depth tumor/normal and allele frequencies of dbSNP variants
      - somatic(): add cnv count - QCValue("somatic CNVs count", "", "Needs to be implemented.", "QC:2000044")
      - somatic(): consider to use only filtered variants for statistics?
- cppNGS-Tests:
   - VariantFilter: Overview gene lists (missing genotype): treat all variants as homozygous?
   - Statistics: add Tests for somatic statistics

GSvar:
* sub-panels: add dialog to archive/restore
* variant detail view: show filter values
- Allow handling of several affected (i.e. integrate SampleOverview functionality)
- Color variant lines by gene, not by odd/even lines
* Implement update tool that automatically checks for new versions, or find solution with reference to sub-folders (ask Martin)
- Add buttons to search in goolge/pubmed for variant

Tools:
* MappingQC: Add "clipped base percentage" parameter for soft-clipped und hard-clipped bases.
* VariantFilterRegions, etc: Set input file format by command line argument => allow reading variant lists from stdin
* MappingQC: support RNA: insert size, spike-in controls, mapping ribosomes/globulines, etc.
- SeqPurge:
  ? try using QBitArray instead of QByteArray to speed up sequence match counting.
  ? try pre-calculating all probabilities (bounded by factorial overflow) and test performance on large dataset.
  ? low-quality trimming before adapter trimming? use single-base instead of sliding window?
- SomaticQC: write test

CnvHunter:
 * refactoring use shared pointers to exons/samples instead of indices (readability!)
 * add optional percentile normalization
 * add optional GC-normalization (then, check GS151166_01 gene C5orf42)
 * Check HaloPlex HS data
 - FÃ¼r alle/wichtige CNAs Plot (log-ratio/z-score/call) mit Umgebung
 - integrate CNV databases:
   - http://dgv.tcag.ca/gb2/gbrowse/dgv2_hg19/
   - https://decipher.sanger.ac.uk/disorders#syndromes/overview
   - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbvar
 ? normalize Z-scores to mean 0 and stdev 1 to correct for sample quality
 ? instead of fixed 'n', use n>=10 and n<=30 with highest correlation or lowest z-score stdev?
 ? output: median instead of mean for "CNV events/sample/100 regions" and "regions/CNV event"
