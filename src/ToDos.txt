=== TODO ===

libs:
*** use HTSlib instead of bamtools
- VariantList:
    - determine file format from file header instead of file name => make more tools pipeable (MS)
    - use QSharedPointers to link VariantAnnotationHeaders with VariantAnnotationDescriptions (CS)
    - check vcf and tsv files if valid - columns and their descriptions (CS)
- NGSHelper: consider soft-clipping of secondary alignments (CS)

GSvar:
* Somatic: also load CNV file of germline
* text-based filter for OMIM/ClinVar/HGMD column (ignore case)
- Add genotype equal for affected
- Make default filters configurable in INI file

Tools:
- Remove UMI tools that are no longer used: BamDeduplicateByBarcode, FastqExtractBarcode?
** add new tool BedHighCoverage (wait until HTSlib available)
- SampleCorrelation: Add option to use only rare snps e.g. 0.1-10.0% AF in VCF/GSvar mode (MS)
- SomaticQC: do not use precalculated triplet counts, count every time (CS)
- BamClipOverlap: require sorted bam and paired-end sequencing (CS)
- VariantAnnotateStrand:
    - add column prefix (CS)
    - extend test for indels (CS)
    - refactor and combine indel and snv handling (CS)

External:
** implement MultiQC support for ReadQC/MappingQC/VariantQC/SomaticQC
** implement ngs-bits module in BioConda

CnvHunter:
** test GC-normalization (check GS151166_01 C5orf42, DX170123_01 SEC23B del)
    - test effect of including different flanking regions
    - alternatively, test intra-sample normalization using the most similar exons on different chromosomes
* test with duplicate reads; with anomalous reads; with multi-mapped reads; chunked data
- allow input of one multi-sample COV file (reduce test data size and loading time)

RohHunter:
- optimize quality cutoffs based on variants that are het on chrX for males (AF, DP, MQM, blacklist, InDels, no AF annotation, homopolymer region,...)
- test splitting regions when dist is too high, e.g. > 100Kb => Q-score cutoff removes random parts?!
- test input of high-cov ROI to augment the input data with WT SNPs with AF>1-5%
- test if sub-population AF improves result
- benchmarks: chrX of males, add errors up to 2 percent, overlap WGS/WES
