=== TODO ===

libs:
- cppNGS:
   - VariantList:
      - use QSharedPointers to link VariantAnnotationHeaders with VariantAnnotationDescriptions (CS)
      - check vcf and tsv files if valid - columns and their descriptions (CS)
   - NGSHelper: consider soft-clipping of secondary alignments (CS)

GSvar:
** LOVD upload for variant
*** GenePicker dialog: fix Pheno to genes associations (breast carcinoma => BRCA1, BRCA2)
- Allow handling of several related samples (i.e. integrate SampleOverview functionality) and allow filtering based on affected status
- Allow filtering of multi-sample variant lists => missing genotype (perhaps treat all variants as homozygous?)
? Add buttons to search in goolge/pubmed for variant
? Add MutationTaster link

Tools:
* MappingQC: support RNA: insert size, spike-in controls, mapping ribosomes/globulines, etc.
* SomaticQC: do not use precalculated triplet counts, count every time (CS)
* BamClipOverlap: require sorted bam and paired-end sequencing (CS)

CnvHunter:
 * compare results for GS160779_01 and GS160801_01 (same sample, different DNA extraction)
 * update test data (include MAPQ=0, types: HBOC, TruRisk, Exome, Low-coverage genome data, Cancer data)
 * look at properties of bad regions (HLA, common CNVs, GC, size, centromer, pseudo-autosomal region, ...)
   - PAR: http://blog.kokocinski.net/index.php/par-regions?blog=2
   - TEL/CENT: http://blog.kokocinski.net/index.php/telomeric-and-centromeric-regions?blog=2
 * test GC-normalization (check e.g. GS151166_01 gene C5orf42)
    - test effect of including different flanking regions
    - alternatively, test intra-sample normalization using the most similar exons on different chromosomes
 * test percentile normalization
 * test on multi-mapped data, chunked data
 - integrate CNV databases:
