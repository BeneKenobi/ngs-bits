=== TODO ===

libs:
- VariantList:
    - determine file format from file header instead of file name => make more tools pipeable (MS)
    - use QSharedPointers to link VariantAnnotationHeaders with VariantAnnotationDescriptions (CS)
    - check vcf and tsv files if valid - columns and their descriptions (CS)
- NGSHelper: consider soft-clipping of secondary alignments (CS)

GSvar:
* Candidate gene dialog: add classification column
* Gap report: add avg. coverage
* Add genotype equal for affected
* Add inheritance mode to gene column => allow filtering
- CandiateGeneDialog: allow sorting by sample/variant/etc
- Allow settings disease_group/disease_status for multi-sample GSvar files
- Multi-sample anaysis: allow relaxing affected/control genotype filters by requiring only X out of Y
- Target region filter: reset to none if it looses focus in search mode
** ClinVar/LOVD upload for variant:
  - implement dialog where user can double-check the data before upload
  - implement print-out of upload data for patient file

Tools:
** NGSDImportHPO: Add augment mode.
* NGSDImportGeneInfo: add (optional) import of inheritance mode from OMIM
- SomaticQC: do not use precalculated triplet counts, count every time (CS)
- BamClipOverlap: require sorted bam and paired-end sequencing (CS)
- VariantAnnotateStrand:
    - add column prefix (CS)
    - extend test for indels (CS)
    - refactor and combine indel and snv handling (CS)

CnvHunter:
** test GC-normalization (check e.g. GS151166_01 gene C5orf42)
    - test effect of including different flanking regions
    - alternatively, test intra-sample normalization using the most similar exons on different chromosomes
* test with duplicate reads; with anomalous reads; with multi-mapped reads; chunked data
- allow input of one multi-sample COV file (reduce test data size and loading time)
