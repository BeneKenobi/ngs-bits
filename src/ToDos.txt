=== TODO ===

libs:
- VariantList:
    - determine file format from file header instead of file name => make more tools pipeable
    - use QSharedPointers to link VariantAnnotationHeaders with VariantAnnotationDescriptions (CS)
    - check vcf and tsv files if valid - columns and their descriptions (CS)
- NGSHelper: consider soft-clipping of secondary alignments (CS)
- integration of htslib: use pileup, use VCF support

NGSD:
** model sample relation: same sample, parent-child, tumor-normal, siblings
  - use 'same sample' when counting variant frequencies
  - set relations after somatic/trio pipeline is through
** annotate counts with same/different disease group/status separately
* add CNVs and allow classification (wait for ClinCNV)

GSvar:
* Add pLI score (megSAP) and filter for pLI (GSvar) to CNVs (wait for ClinCNV)
* GenLab XML report: male => change 'hom' variants outside PAR region on chrX/chrY to 'hemi' (when GenLab import is updated)
** Trio filter: add imprinting genes using father/mother information
** Report variant selection
    - allow marking variants for report inclusion (report_pathogenic, report_acmg, report_scientific, no_report_artefact, no_report_no_disease_association)
    - store marked variants in NGSD when writing the report (who, when, comment)
    - load marked variants from NGSD after loading the case again
    - add button to show marked variants only

Tools:
- VariantFilterAnnotations: support VCF as well
- VariantQC: insertion/deletion ratio?
* NGSDImportHPO: check that the genes listed for a variant are really affected - e.g. RIF1 is not affected by this variant but listed: clinvar_20171203.vcf:2  152346522       194453  G       A       .       .

- UPDHunter: also support chrX?
- SomaticQC: do not use precalculated triplet counts, count every time (CS)
- SomaticQC: replace 'QC:?' by real qcML identifier (CS)
- BamClipOverlap: require sorted bam and paired-end sequencing (CS)
- BamClipOverlap: use higher base quality in overlap (CS)

External:
** implement MultiQC support for ReadQC/MappingQC/VariantQC/SomaticQC (>JM) ReadQC instead of SeqPurge, define default columns of tables, define plot columns

CnvHunter:
** implement second pass to improve calling for samples with massive CN changes
** add optional parameter with pre-calculated correlation file (skip precalcualted pairs > avoid downsampling)
* Add z-score of #CNVs as QC parameter (megSAP!?)
* Add support for chrY
* test sqrt-normalization
- replace fun_* by methods from BasicStatistics, i.e. rewrite the methods in BasicStatistics as template functions that accept both float and double
- test GC-normalization (check GS151166_01 C5orf42, DX170123_01 SEC23B del)
    - test effect of including different flanking regions
    - alternatively, test intra-sample normalization using the most similar exons on different chromosomes
- test with duplicate reads; with anomalous reads; with multi-mapped reads; chunked data
- allow input of one multi-sample COV file (reduce test data size and loading time)

RohHunter:
- optimize quality cutoffs based on variants that are het on chrX for males (AF, DP, MQM, blacklist, InDels, no AF annotation, homopolymer region,...)
- test splitting regions when dist is too high, e.g. > 100Kb => Q-score cutoff removes random parts?!
- test input of high-cov ROI to augment the input data with WT SNPs with AF>1-5%
- test if sub-population AF improves result
- benchmarks: chrX of males, add errors up to 2 percent, overlap WGS/WES
