=== TODO ===

libs:
- VariantList:
    - determine file format from file header instead of file name => make more tools pipeable (MS)
    - use QSharedPointers to link VariantAnnotationHeaders with VariantAnnotationDescriptions (CS)
    - check vcf and tsv files if valid - columns and their descriptions (CS)
- NGSHelper: consider soft-clipping of secondary alignments (CS)

GSvar:
** Do not show variant lists over 10000 variants without filters => click to show
* Allow settings disease_group/disease_status for multi-sample GSvar files
* Check trio/multisample IGV integration
- multi-sample anaysis: allow relaxing affected/control genotype filters by requiring only X out of Y
- Target region filter: reset to none if it looses focus in search mode
** ClinVar/LOVD upload for variant:
  - implement dialog where user can double-check the data before upload
  - implement print-out of upload data for patient file

Tools:
  * integrate into MappingQC?
  * remove af_deviation from VariantQC?
- NGSDPrecalculate:
  * add check for tumor samples variants that have been imported into 'detected_variant' table
  * add check for outdated gene names in 'geneinfo_germline' and 'hpo_genes'
  * remove/warn when variants/qc-data is present for bad/merged processed samples
- NGSDImportGeneInfo:
  ** add (optional) import of inheritance mode from OMIM
- SomaticQC: do not use precalculated triplet counts, count every time (CS)
- BamClipOverlap: require sorted bam and paired-end sequencing (CS)
- VariantAnnotateStrand:
    - add column prefix (CS)
    - extend test for indels (CS)
    - refactor and combine indel and snv handling (CS)

CnvHunter:
*** calculate stddev from z-scores and show median
*** annotate exons/variants with count of events per exon
** integrate CNV databases:
   - http://dgv.tcag.ca/gb2/gbrowse/dgv2_hg19/
   - https://decipher.sanger.ac.uk/disorders#syndromes/overview
   - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbvar
   - ExAC
* test if re-normalization without CNV regions improves z-score distribution and thus CNV calling results
* look at properties of bad regions (HLA, common CNVs, GC content, size, centromer, pseudo-autosomal region, ...)
   - PAR: http://blog.kokocinski.net/index.php/par-regions?blog=2
   - TEL/CENT: http://blog.kokocinski.net/index.php/telomeric-and-centromeric-regions?blog=2
* test GC-normalization (check e.g. GS151166_01 gene C5orf42)
    - test effect of including different flanking regions
    - alternatively, test intra-sample normalization using the most similar exons on different chromosomes
* test with duplicate reads; with anomalous reads; with multi-mapped reads; chunked data
