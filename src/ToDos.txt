=== TODO ===

libs:
- test cppNGSD (include in libs)
- cppNGS:
   - VariantList:
      - use QSharedPointers to link VariantAnnotationHeaders with VariantAnnotationDescriptions
      - check vcf and tsv files if valid (columns and their descriptions)
   - Statistics:
      - somatic(): normalize mutation signature (plot2) for panels using the reference genome, e.g. count of CCG in target region divided by CCG in the genome
      - somatic(): normalize variant distance (plot3) for panels, e.g. calculate distances by target regions
      - somatic(): add support for freebayes, currently only vcfs from strelka can be used
      - somatic(): add plot comparing depth tumor/normal and allele frequencies of dbSNP variants
      - somatic(): add cnv count - QCValue("somatic CNVs count", "", "Needs to be implemented.", "QC:2000044")
      - somatic(): consider to use only filtered variants for statistics?
- cppNGS-Tests:
   - Statistics: add Tests for somatic statistics

GSvar:
* Overview gene lists (missing genotype): treat all variants as homozygous?

Tools:
* BedLowCoverage: Write region names from input regions to output regions (merged).
- MappingQC:
  - add %soft/hard-clipped quality parameter (see ssPWBRCA_v2)
  * support RNA: insert size, spike-in controls, mapping ribosomes/globulines, etc.
- SeqPurge:
  - use mutexes only if running in multi-thread mode (check if this speeds up processing)
  - low-quality trimming before adapter trimming? use single-base instead of sliding window?
? FastqDemultiplex: check for "carry-over" contamination from last run
? ReadQC: create plots without python
- SomaticQC:
   - write test
- VcfCheck: Format check for vcf files

CnvHunter:
 * instead of fixed 'n', use n>=10 and n<=30 with highest correlation or lowest z-score stdev?
 * normalize Z-scores to mean 0 and stdev 1 to correct for sample quality
 * merge larger regions to one region - use CBS or slope-based algorithm based on cummulative relative coverage.
