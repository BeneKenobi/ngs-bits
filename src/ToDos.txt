=== TODO ===

libs:
- test cppNGSD (include in libs)

GSvar:
* Overview gene lists: treat all variants as homozygous?
* Gene info table: Inititialize from OMIM, if parsing of inheritance is available

Tools:
* BedLowCoverage: Write region names from input regions to output regions (merged).
- MappingQC:
  - add %soft/hard-clipped quality parameter (see ssPWBRCA_v2)
  * support RNA: insert size, spike-in controls, mapping ribosomes/globulines, etc.
- SeqPurge:
  - use mutexes only if running in multi-thread mode (check if this speeds up processing)
  - low-quality trimming before adapter trimming? use single-base instead of sliding window?
? FastqDemultiplex: check for "carry-over" contamination from last run
? ReadQC: create plots without python

CnvHunter:
 * instead of fixed 'n', use n>=10 and n<=30 with highest correlation or lowest z-score stdev?
 * normalize Z-scores to mean 0 and stdev 1 to correct for sample quality
 * merge larger regions to one region - use CBS or slope-based algorithm based on cummulative relative coverage.
 - integrate CNV databases:
