=== TODO ===

libs:
- cppNGS:
   - VariantList:
      - use QSharedPointers to link VariantAnnotationHeaders with VariantAnnotationDescriptions (CS)
      - check vcf and tsv files if valid - columns and their descriptions (CS)
   - NGSHelper: consider soft-clipping of secondary alignments (CS)

GSvar:
* Gaps: Implement gaps window that shows gaps (CCDS+2 in red) and allows jumping to the IGV position and records which gaps should be closed in NGSD.
- Allow handling of several affected (i.e. integrate SampleOverview functionality)
- Allow filtering of multi-sample variant lists => missing genotype (perhaps treat all variants as homozygous?)
? Add buttons to search in goolge/pubmed for variant
? Add MutationTaster link

Tools:
* MappingQC: support RNA: insert size, spike-in controls, mapping ribosomes/globulines, etc.
* SomaticQC: do not use precalculated triplet counts, count every time (CS)
* BamClipOverlap: require sorted bam and paired-end sequencing (CS)

CnvHunter:
 ** check why some samples have so many CNVs
 ** check why CN=3 regions are so fragmented - check in Cyto-WGS samples too
 * update test data (include MAPQ=0, types: HBOC, TruRisk, Exome, Low-coverage genome data, Cancer data)
 * look at properties of bad regions (HLA, common CNVs, GC, size, centromer, pseudo-autosomal region, ...)

   - TEL/CENT: http://blog.kokocinski.net/index.php/telomeric-and-centromeric-regions?blog=2
 * add optional GC-normalization (then, check GS151166_01 gene C5orf42) - test effect of including different flanking regions
 * test calculate real ncov distribution also when enough data points are available. How many are that? Test/simulate! (see line ~700: 'values.count()==n')
 * test mappability-normalization
 * test percentile normalization
 * test on multi-mapped data, chunked data

 - integrate CNV databases:
