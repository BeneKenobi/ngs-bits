=== TODO ===

libs:
- VariantList:
    - determine file format from file header instead of file name => make more tools pipeable (MS)
    - use QSharedPointers to link VariantAnnotationHeaders with VariantAnnotationDescriptions (CS)
    - check vcf and tsv files if valid - columns and their descriptions (CS)
- NGSHelper: consider soft-clipping of secondary alignments (CS)

GSvar:
** LOVD: upload compound-het variants together ('variant' twice)
* Docu: LOVD upload, ROH
** Trio dialog: allow different processing systems - also show quality
*** Gap report split to ccds+-5 and all gaps
# subpanel design dialog: use existing as template
- Add genotype equal for affected
* Add inheritance mode to gene column => allow filtering
- Allow settings disease_group/disease_status for multi-sample GSvar files
- Multi-sample anaysis: allow relaxing affected/control genotype filters by requiring only X out of Y
- Target region filter: reset to none if it looses focus in search mode

Tools:
** add new tool BedHighCoverage (wait until bamtools is replaced by HTSlib)
** add tool NGSDVariants: filter genes, filter impact, filter max AF, filter max ihdb, output formats TSV/GSvar/VCF
** NGSDImportHPO: Add augment mode.
# NGSDImportGeneInfo: add (optional) import of inheritance mode from OMIM
- SampleCorrelation: Use only rare snps e.g. below 5% AF, but only when they are known variants (MS)
- SomaticQC: do not use precalculated triplet counts, count every time (CS)
- BamClipOverlap: require sorted bam and paired-end sequencing (CS)
- VariantAnnotateStrand:
    - add column prefix (CS)
    - extend test for indels (CS)
    - refactor and combine indel and snv handling (CS)

CnvHunter:
** test GC-normalization (check GS151166_01 C5orf42, DX170123_01 SEC23B del)
    - test effect of including different flanking regions
    - alternatively, test intra-sample normalization using the most similar exons on different chromosomes
* test with duplicate reads; with anomalous reads; with multi-mapped reads; chunked data
- allow input of one multi-sample COV file (reduce test data size and loading time)

RohHunter:
- optimize quality cutoffs based on variants that are het on chrX for males (AF, DP, MQM, blacklist, InDels, no AF annotation, homopolymer region,...)
- test splitting regions when dist is too high, e.g. > 100Kb => Q-score cutoff removes random parts?!
- test input of high-cov ROI to augment the input data with WT SNPs with AF>1-5%
- test if sub-population AF improves result
- benchmarks: chrX of males, add errors up to 2 percent, overlap WGS/WES
