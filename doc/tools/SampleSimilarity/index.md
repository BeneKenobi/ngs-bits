# SampleSimilarity documentation

SampleSimilarity calculates several metrics that measure sample similarity:

 * overlap: Percentage of variants that occur in both samples (not considering the genotype).
 * correlation: Correlation of the genotypes based on overlapping variants.

Absolute cutoffs values for for same sample, parent-child pairs etc. do not exist, since they depend on the enrichment kit that was used.   
Example data for exome data (Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon V6) are shown here:
